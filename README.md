| 14 Points | "W. Edwards Deming’s 14 management practices to help companies increase their quality and productivity: (1) create constancy of purpose for improving products and services; (2) adopt the new philosophy; (3) cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality; (4) end the practice of awarding business on price alone; instead, minimize total cost by working with a single supplier; (5) improve constantly and forever every process for planning, production, and service; (6) institute training on the job; (7) adopt and institute leadership; (8) drive out fear; (9) break down barriers between staff areas; (10) eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce; (11) eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management; (12) remove barriers that rob people of pride of workmanship and eliminate the annual rating or merit system; (13) institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone; and (14) put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. Syn: Deming’s 14 Points." |

| ABC classification | "The classification of a group of items in decreasing order of annual dollar volume (price multiplied by projected volume) or other criteria. This array is then split into three classes, called A, B, and C. The A group usually represents 10 percent to 20 percent by number of items and 50 percent to 70 percent by projected dollar volume. The next grouping, B, usually represents about 20 percent of the items and about 20 percent of the dollar volume. The C class contains 60 percent to 70 percent of the items and represents about 10 percent to 30 percent of the dollar volume. The ABC principle states that effort and money can be saved through applying looser controls to the low-dollar-volume class items than to the high-dollar-volume class items. The ABC principle is applicable to inventories, purchasing, and sales. Syn: ABC analysis, distribution by value. See: 80-20, Pareto analysis, Pareto’s law." |

Provides a simplified and more accurate form of direct costing that subtracts true variable costs (those costs that vary with throughput quantity). Unlike traditional cost accounting systems in which the focus is generally placed on reducing costs in all the various accounts, the primary focus of TOC accounting is on aggressively exploiting the constraint(s) to make more money for the firm.

| time period safety stock | "A safety stock that is based on usage over a designated time frame. The period can be set as days, weeks, or months. Safety stock varies directly with demand. This differs from statistical-based safety stocks in that the amount is not based on deviation from demand." |
| time-phased order point (TPOP) | "MRP-like time planning logic technique for independent demand items, where gross requirements come from a forecast, not via explosion. Can be used to plan distribution center inventories as well as to plan for service (repair) parts, because MRP logic can readily handle items with dependent demand, independent demand, or a combination of both. An approach that uses time periods, thus allowing for lumpy withdrawals instead of average demand. When used in distribution environments, the planned order releases are input to the master schedule dependent demands. See: fixed reorder quantity inventory model." |
| time phasing | "The technique of expressing future demand, supply, and inventories by time period. Time phasing is one of the key elements of material requirements planning." |

Traditionally, variable production costs are direct labor, direct material, and variable overhead costs. Variable costing can be helpful for internal management analysis but is not widely accepted for external financial reporting. For inventory order quantity purposes, however, the unit costs must include both the variable and allocated fixed costs to be compatible with the other terms in the order quantity formula. For make-or-buy decisions, variable costing should be used rather than full absorption costing. Syn: direct costing." |
| variable overhead | "All manufacturing costs, other than direct labor and direct materials, that vary directly with production volume. Variable overhead is necessary to produce the product, but cannot be directly assigned to a specific product." |

| VATI analysis | "In the theory of constraints, a procedure for determining the general flow of parts and products from raw materials to finished products (logical product structure). A V logical structure starts with one or a few raw materials, and the product expands into a number of different products as it flows through divergent points in its routings. The shape of an A logical structure is dominated by converging points. Many raw materials are fabricated and assembled into a few finished products. A T logical structure consists of numerous similar finished products assembled from common assemblies, subassemblies, and parts. An I logical structure is the simplest of production flows, where resources are shared between different products and the flow is in a straight line sequence (e.g., an assembly line). Once the general parts flow is determined, the system control points (gating operations, convergent points, divergent points, constraints, and shipping points) can be identified and managed." |

| "vital few, useful many" | "A term used by J.M. Juran to describe his use of the Pareto principle in quality management, which he first described in 1950. (The principle was used much earlier in economics and inventory control methodologies.) The principle suggests that most effects come from relatively few causes; that is, 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the possible causes. The 20 percent of the possible causes are referred to as the “vital few”; the remaining causes are referred to as the “useful many.” When Juran first defined this principle, he referred to the remaining causes as the “trivial many,” but since no problems are trivial in quality assurance, he changed it to “useful many.”" |
